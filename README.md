## How to run
You will need to have Node **10.16.0** or later on your local development machine. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.

### First install all dependencies
```sh
cd frontend && npm i
```

### To start the local server
```sh
npm start
```

### Open app in browser
Once the app is compiled and bundled successfully you should see this screen in your browser. This would be your starting point of the project.
